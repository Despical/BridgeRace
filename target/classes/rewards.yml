#             Bridge Race Rewards Configuration
#
#                    Placeholders list:
#             %player% - Current player name
#             %mapname% - Name of map
#             %arena-id% - Arena Identifier
#             %players% - Number of players in game
#
#        Commands are executed by default by CONSOLE, use "p:" to preform command by player
#  You can use chance to execute command adding "chance(NUMBER):" (ex chance(10):) at the beginning of command
#
#  Commands examples:
#    - p:say Hello everyone in %mapname%!             # Player will say "Hello everyone in <map name here>"
#    - broadcast Game %arena-id% has ended!           # Will broadcast "Game <arena name here> has ended" message
#    - chance(1):p:say I was very lucky!              # Player has %1 chance to say "I was very lucky!"
#    - p:chance(99):spawn                             # Player has %99 chance to teleport to spawn
#       ^ YOU CANt EVEN SWAP CHANCE WITH PLAYER!
#    - chance(50):eco give %player% 10                # Console has %50 chance to give player 10$
#
#    Just add example reward:
#    - script:player.sendMessage("oh, hi %player%");      # It will send "oh, hi <player name>" to player! 100% plain Java!
#    - script:server.broadcastMessage("hello everyone");  # Broadcasts "hello everyone" to whole server
#    - script:player.getInventory().addItem(new org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack(org.bukkit.Material.DIRT));
#         ^ Gives player dirt item (you must always use direct package names for not provided objects)
#
#                               All script provided objects:
#            player - Player object (API methods https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)
